# Sublime Context Free Grammar Aid
A sublime syntax file and a few snippets to make handling and writing CFGs easier, because I would rather procrastinate my homework this way.

All these files should go in something like 

`C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User`

An easier and less elegant way to find this directory is to create a new snippet, and from that file view click "Open File...", and that is this directory.

I also included handy keybindings

This won't be maintained most likely, but it could be useful to maybe that one person.

To trigger the rule snippet, type 'rr<tab>' which should bring up '[rule] -> [production]'
